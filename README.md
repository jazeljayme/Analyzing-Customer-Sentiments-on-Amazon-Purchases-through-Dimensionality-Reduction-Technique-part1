 # Amazon Kindle: Analyzing Customer Sentiments on E-book Purchases

<p align="justify">The growth of E-book use continued to spike upward especially after the release of the iPhone in 2007 and the very first Android phone in 2008. As the years went by smartphone and tablet technologies started to become more powerful and more affordable in the year 2010s this has seen a strong boost in sales of E-books especially from Amazon's kindle store where people no longer needed special devices to access E-book file systems.</p>

<p align="justify">A good number of people still seem to prefer text media over film or other forms of media. Interestingly, many highly-rated movies are based on books. The researchers have deemed it fit to dive deeper on the certain factors that make e-books salable and which e-books are given more attention based on sales and ratings. The common sentiments of the reviews were also explored to be able to gain more insights as to which are the common words that are attributed to excellently performing e-books or poorly rated ones. Additionally, topic modeling was implemented to customers' reviews, to show their benefits practically in detecting important topics or issues written by readers. The findings may give ideas to authors or publishers on how to improve their crafts or strategize better to increase sales and make readers happy.</p>
